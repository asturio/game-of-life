The Game of Life

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

# Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
5. In this version of the game, the edges are not wrapped. All cells outside the grid are considered dead.

# How to run

Modify the code in GameOfLifeStarter.java to create a game of life with your implementation. Select which
implementation of the View you want to use.

# Points to look at

- TDD
- Code Coverage
- SOLID
- Clean Code

# If you want

- Refactor the code
- Choose another implementation for the board model
- Choose another implementation for the view
- Choose another implementation for the behaviour by the edges
